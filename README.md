# Habit Tracker

## Idea Overview

I will be creating a habit tracker that allows a user to track if they are following through on their habits they want to instill. The user can:

- Add a new habit to track
- Track the number of times habit has been performed
- See progress against goal
- Delete a habit
- View completed habits

What the application won't do (unless I have time):
- Manage multiple users
- Include user sign up and authentication

## Technologies

I plan to use **ReactJS** for the front-end, **NodeJS** for the back-end, and **mongodb + mongoose** for the backend. If mongo proves to be challenging, I will use firebase. If I end up implementing user management and authentication, I will use firebase.
